# RPS HTML

Your goal is to create a website that looks and works like this one:

http://rps-html-target.herokuapp.com/

It's a pretty bad game right now — the computer always plays the same moves. We'll make it smarter soon.

For now, we're just trying to learn how to make the pages _look_ the way we want.

## Setup

 - From [your Cloud9 repositories list](https://c9.io/account/repos), set up a workspace [as usual](https://guides.firstdraft.com/starting-on-a-project-in-cloud9).
 - Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 - Start your Rails application by clicking the "Run Project" button at the top of the Cloud9 IDE.
 - Navigate to your live application by finding the URL in the Terminal tab that popped up to run the server, clicking on it and saying "Open", or copy-pasting it into a new Chrome Tab.

    Alternatively you can go to the Cloud9 "Preview" menu and select "Preview Running Application" (**not** "Live Preview"), but I suggest clicking on the small arrow icon next to the address bar to pop the window into its own Chrome tab so that you're not wasting IDE real estate on it.
 - Initially you may see an orange warning page that Cloud9 annoys you with to ensure that you're not using the preview for real users (they don't want the traffic).

     Click through that and then you may see a page that says "Yay! You’re on Rails!". That means your server started up successfully. We now need to start building some pages.
 - Create a file in the `/public` folder called `rock.html`. In that file, enter some text — you know what it should say by now:

    ```html
    Hello, world!
    ```
 - In your live application, navigate to the URL that you just built — add `/rock` onto the end of the homepage URL. It will look something like this:

    ```
    https://rps-html-demostudent8.c9users.io/rock
    ```

    , assuming that you named your workspace `rps-html`; but your own username will be where you see `demostudent8`.

    Congratulations! Your very first web page. As you update the source code with more stuff, be sure to save the source code first and then refresh the live app in Chrome to see the new version.

## Your job

Now your job is to, page by page, make your application match [the target](http://rps-html-target.herokuapp.com/rock).

Use the [HTML Reference Chapter](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/771) to try and find elements that will help.

When you get to the rules page, here are the URLs of the images:

## Next up

In [the next project](http://rps-css-target.herokuapp.com/), we'll learn how to take the content that we've tagged up with HTML and add some style with CSS.
